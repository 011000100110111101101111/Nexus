**This site is very much in its early stage, the majority of my projects still live in my github compared to in the blogging section here. I am transitioning them incremenetally, as I want the blog post guides to be nice to read :D**

# ⚙️ Welcome to my personal website!

After having numerous areas where I have kept my projects and resources, I finally decided to congregate them in a single location. Over the next few weeks I will transition my DevOps projects, work experience, personal interests, school work, and more to this website. If you would like to learn a bit more about me, head to the [**about**]({{ site.baseurl }}/about) page, or check out some of the books I have enjoyed [**here**]({{ site.baseurl }}/library). If you want to look through some of the already uploaded guides, head over to the [**blogs**]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog) page.

This home page will become more flushed out in the near future after I complete uploading everything. Incase you want to look directly at my projects, check out my [**repo**](https://github.com/011000100110111101101111/Nexus) containing the majority of them.
