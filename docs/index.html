    <p>Welcome to my website! <strong>Nexus</strong> will become my centralized place to upload projects, guides, and personal aspects of my life. For context, the majority of the content will be DevOps technologies revolving around Kubernetes, as well as numerous programming languages, and other technologies I find interesting. The website itself is actually my way of learning html, css, and javascript, so it will continue to evolve as my skills improve.</p>
