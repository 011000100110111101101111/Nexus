We will discuss the deployment of kubernetes on bare metal machines. This was important to me for use in my homelab, where I needed bare metal solutions to use on my hardware.

The topics we will cover consist of,

- Pre-Installation Requirements
- Kubeadm setup
- CNI setup
- CSI setup
- Loadbalancer setup
- Ingress setup
- Automated Deployment with Ansible
