## About

I initially found it a bit overwhelming starting to learn the technologies for web development, and wished there was a simple roadmap or discussion to follow that had previous failures and tips for advancement. I didn't find one... but I will leave one behind for the next person! This post will be in chronological order of what I learned, why I learned it, if it was useful and any hardships I ran into along the path. I hope this helps someone else down the line. Lets get into the pathway.

### HTML + CSS

I kicked my journey off with HTML and CSS. In my opinion it was extremely helpful to learn these side by side compared to consecutively because when it clicked it really clicked. It also gives the advantage of reinforcing the other language while learning. What I mean is if you introduce a new HTML element to the page, you can then apply what you have already learned from CSS to that element, reinforcing the knowledge. This is compared to making an entire HTML page, then apply CSS to it once as you are learning it. Obviously this is just my two cents, but I found it accelerated my learning.

Here are some great resources I used during this process.

- [W3Schools HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/)
- [W3Schools CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/css/)
- [FreeCodeCamp HTML Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=916GWv2Qs08&list=PLWKjhJtqVAbmMuZ3saqRIBimAKIMYkt0E&index=3)
- [FreeCodeCamp CSS Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OXGznpKZ_sA&list=PLWKjhJtqVAbmMuZ3saqRIBimAKIMYkt0E&index=3)

The following videos REALLY made it click once I had some basic knowledge.

Another topic I would mention is design. When you are learning, for all means go all out. It teaches you more and is fun. However, at some point I realized that more is not better. A simple website with great colors looks WAY better than a overcomplex design with shading and tons of colors and everything else. It looks professional, and it looks CLEAN. This was important to take my website design from something that looked like it belonged in 2005, to a trendy current site.
