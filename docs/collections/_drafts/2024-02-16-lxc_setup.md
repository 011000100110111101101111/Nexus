The microceph package makes setting up a cluster easier. It includes numerous dependencies required.

**Guide results**

**Prerequisites**

- Everything is done on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS server.
- You must have atleast 3 nodes.

To start, we will initiate lxd.

```bash
lxd init
```

You will now be presented with a LOT of questions. Here are the explanations

```bash
# Create a cluster
Would you like to use LXD clustering? (yes/no) [default=no]: yes
# 'Control-plane' IP for the cluster. Defaults to IP of machine you run it on
What IP address or DNS name should be used to reach this server? [default=192.168.3.200]:
# Pretty straight forward.
Are you joining an existing cluster? (yes/no) [default=no]: no
# 'Control-plane' Hostname for the cluster. Defaults to Hostname of machine you run it on
What member name should be used to identify this server in the cluster? [default=k8-master-1]:
# We will create a new one. However you can also implement it with CEPH or other storages.
Do you want to configure a new local storage pool? (yes/no) [default=yes]:
# ZFS by default, just type of storage to use
Name of the storage backend to use (btrfs, dir, lvm, zfs) [default=zfs]:
# If you had exisitng pool you could use it, we will create new
Create a new ZFS pool? (yes/no) [default=yes]:
# Do you have a disk you can attach to this? I do not, so i said no.
Would you like to use an existing empty block device (e.g. a disk or partition)? (yes/no) [default=no]: no
# Size
Size in GiB of the new loop device (1GiB minimum) [default=9GiB]: 2GiB
# Again, could be ceph or others, for us no.
Do you want to configure a new remote storage pool? (yes/no) [default=no]: no
# No
Would you like to connect to a MAAS server? (yes/no) [default=no]:
# To get public ip addresses on the containers in the cluster itself then you must anwser yes.
Would you like to configure LXD to use an existing bridge or host interface? (yes/no) [default=no]: yes
# Name of interface for host. Get with -> ip a
Name of the existing bridge or host interface: ens18
# uh
Would you like stale cached images to be updated automatically? (yes/no) [default=yes]:
# No need
Would you like a YAML "lxd init" preseed to be printed? (yes/no) [default=no]:
```

Okay, now lets join a worker.
