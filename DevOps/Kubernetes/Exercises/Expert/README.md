# Developing Exercises

The tasks in this directory will be in a inject / task format. You will be presented with a end goal, and you will implement it yourself. This may require numerous interactions from basic and developing, as well as independent research for new tools.

The underlying theme in these will build on eachother, each task will add to the previous one. For example, if one has you implement a web server for external users, the next may have you move this to a pipeline.

If you are able to solve the majority of these exercises from scratch, you will have a good understanding of Kubernetes.
